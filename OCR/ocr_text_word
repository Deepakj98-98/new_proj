Artificial intelligence in business is the use of AI tools such as machine learning natural language processing and computer vision to optimize business functions boost employee productivity and drive business value.
Artificial intelligence or the development of computer systems andmachine learningto mimic the problemsolving and decisionmaking capabilities of human intelligence impacts an array of business processes. Organizations useartificial intelligence AIto strengthen data analysis and decisionmaking improvecustomer experiences generate content optimizeIT operations sales marketing andcybersecuritypractices and more. As AI technologies improve and evolve new business applications emerge.
Artificial intelligence is used as a tool to support a human workforce in optimizingworkflowsand making business operations more efficient. These gains are made in various ways including using AI to automate repetitive tasks generate information based on machine learning algorithms quickly process vast amounts of data sets and extract meaningful insights and predict future outcomes based on data analysis. AI systems power several types ofbusiness automation includingenterprise automationand process automation helping to reduce human error and free up human workforces for higherlevel work.
According to McKinsey  Company the use of artificial intelligence in business operations has doubled since 2017.1This is largely because AI technology can be customized to meet an organizations unique needs. 63 of McKinseys respondents expect their investment in AI technologies to increase over the next three years.2To use AI in aneffective business strategy an organization must have a clear understanding of its business functions how AI works and what aspects of the business can be improved through AI implementation.
While the use of AI tools to automate repetitive tasks and increaseemployee productivityremains popular businesses are also moving beyond these use cases and using AI to assist in higherlevel strategic initiatives that help drive broader business value.
Artificial intelligence A brief overview
Artificial intelligence the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs3uses large amounts of data and human knowledge to power computer systems with the ability to categorize data make predictions identify errors have conversations and analyze information in a similar way to humans.
One of the goals of artificial intelligence is to create computer systems that can mimic the critical thinking skills of humans. These systems rely on business data and use technologies like natural language processing NLP machine learning ML and deep learning to facilitate business operations. Integrating AI into business functions requires a baseline understanding of the following components
Machine learning algorithms
These algorithms are a subset of artificial intelligence and are used to make predictions or classifications based on input data. Through training data sets these algorithms can learn to identify patterns discover anomalies or make projections such as future sales revenue.Machine learning algorithmshelp mine large datasets for key insights that can offer realworld benefits for improved business decisions. Machine learning algorithms benefit from labeled data which is data that a human expert categorizes before it is processed.
