It's growing Culture and leadership are the two things that make up a successful organization. And leaders need to navigate different cultural contexts make sure everyone understands what you're saying. Talks about cross cultural leadership And he says that culture has a big impact diversity Geert Hofstead created a framework for understanding cultural differences yes Its interesting how those cultural values shape leadership What scene is strong in one culture might be disrespectful It’s the ability to work well in different cultures You have a good sense of humor. It's getting a lot of attention It's good for business. Women are more likely to have a positive impact on society Women are half the workforce, but underrepresented in leadership It's a gap in the definition. Those who are disadvantaged are more likely to be repressed. Yes They're collaborative, empathetic and good at building relationships We need to recognize and value those contributions He says its not about gender, but about skills, experience, and commitment. We need to create a more supportive environment for women leaders. They need to be proactive in identifying and addressing potential threats to their business. Create mentorship programs offer leadership training for women And build a culture that supports women leaders No Yes It leads to better decisions, innovation, and a more engaged workforce They should be willing to work with people of all backgrounds and cultures Yoko is a senior lecturer at the University of Cambridge. Exactly I will Respecting and embracing differences is a key part of fostering an inclusive society. Exactly Yes It's about people. Leadership isn’t a destination. It's a journey It's about constantly learning and adapting Its about embracing the journey Its inspiring to think of leadership as a journey that unfolds throughout our lives And it offers opportunities for growth at every stage Its for anyone who wants to make a difference It is. he is a good man. We need to cultivate our potential in order to be a successful person. Be proactive and intentional about development it s about being true to yourself he shook his head and said, "It's not a question of whether or not we're going to get robbed." Building trust means building relationships. And that's what we're all about. Be present Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and recognize your own strengths and weaknesses. Self-awareness is so important It helps you be authentic and empathetic. This has been a great deep dive Its been insightful I hope so He's a leader in the field.

AI is a technology that will change the way we do business. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning that uses reinforcement to train the brain. The agent can interact with the environment to obtain some rewards. The agent should take actions so as to maximize cumulative rewards. The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn a good strategy for the agent from experiments and relative simple feedback received. The optimal strategy is based on the agent's knowledge of the environment. Key Concepts in RL The agent is a person. a model is based on the knowledge of the environment The agent can stay in one of manystatessS of the environment and choose to take one or more actionsaA to switch from one state to another. a reward The model defines the reward function and transition probabilities. We may or may not know how the model works and this differentiate two circumstances. Know the Model planning with perfect information do modelbased RL. We can find the optimal solution by Dynamic ProgrammingDP. no modelfree RL This is a list of the most common scenarios. The agent's policiesprovides the guideline on what is the optimal action to take in a certain state with the goal to maximize the total rewards. Value functionVs is the expected amount of future rewards we are able to receive in this state by acting the corresponding policy. The value function is a measure of the quality of an object. value functions Fig. The symbiosis of a tetrahedron and an equilateral triangle. a. b. RL is based on a model of the value policy. timet12T. The agent learns the optimal policy and makes decisions on which action to take next so as to efficiently learn the best policy asStAt and Rt Model-based RL algorithms are based on a model of the environment  - Powered by Discuz! GMT+8 , 2019-4-23 1904 . No dependency on the model during learning. Onpolicy == Offpolicy Training on the distribution of transitions or episodes produced by a different behavior policy rather than that produced Transition and Reward The model is a descriptor of the environment The model can also be used to learn or infer how the environment would interact with the agent. The transition probability function P is the probability that we will arrive in the next state s. The reward function R is a function that determines how much reward we get.

DP is a computer program Common Approaches RL is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to solve many types of real-world problems. The first approach is to use a symbiotic relationship between the two organisms. The second approach involves combining the phylogenetic and molecular approaches. Dynamic Programming (DP) is a programming language that can be used to iteratively evaluate value functions and improve policy. TD Learning is model-free and learns from episodes of experience. TD learning is so important that Sutton Barto 2017 in their RL book describes it as one idea central and novel to reinforcement learning. The problem of exploration vs exploitation dilemma has been discussed in my previous post. The following is a list of known problems. Exploration and exploitation RL algorithms balance between exploration and exploitation in different ways. The exploration is captured by the policy parameter perturbation. This is a very important point to keep in mind. TD methods that involve bootstrapping. Case Study AlphaGo Zero The game of Gohas been an extremely hard problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence for decades until recent years. AlphaGo Zero is a version of the game Alpha Go that was developed by DeepMind. How do the algorithms work? AlphaGo Zero is a computer game that uses reinforcement learning and self-play to learn basic rules. Fig. The symbiosis of a tetrahedron and an equilateral triangle. the board. AlphaGo Zero is a strategy game that was developed by the same people that made the original game. The game is played with two players, one on each side of the board. Each player has ten moves to make, and each player starts with 0 moves. If one player loses, the other player will take their place. The first value is the number of nodes in the network.
