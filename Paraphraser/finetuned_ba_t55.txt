The data bases are all around you. You've seen a database in action. With Microsoft access you can manage your own database to suit the needs of your business or maybe the company you work for. What is database? How do databases work, from the simplest to the most complex? A simple database because it only contains two lists. If you were a professional baker your database would contain more. If a database is essentially 'a collection of lists stored in tables and you can build tables in Excel, why access? Why do you need a database? The databases you'll be working with in access can actually understand how different lists and their contents relate to one another. We call this a relational database or its ability to understand relationships and it's really what sets access apart. Even the most complicated tasks can be made simple and user friendly once you understand how access and databases work.
