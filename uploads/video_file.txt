The data bases are all around you Have you ever waited at the doctors office while the receptionist punched in your information or asked a store employee to check their system for a special item? Then youve seen a database in action The truth is theyre so useful you see them all the time With Microsoft access you can manage your own database to suit the needs of your business or maybe be the company you work for But what exactly is a database? Well, its a collection of information or data thats stored on a computer, allowing you to enter, access, and analyze it in a way you never could on paper Lets think about that Before computers, what sort of paper records do you think the doctors off is kept on file? Certainly a list of patients and their contact information? Also their medical history and a list of past appointments? Thats how databases work, from the simplest to the most complex Basically a collection of lists Not on paper but on your computer, where programs like Access make it possible to organize your data, make it searchable and so much more Lets take a look Say you were hardworking amateur baker You might decide to keep a database of all the cookies you know how to make, and the people you make them for, your friends and family A simple database because it only contains two lists If you were a professional baker, your database would contain more Youd have products and customers, and other things to keep track of like pricing sales units and a list of orders Does access actually keep these things in a big long list? Not quite Instead it uses tables like the ones in Excel to list things in a little more detail Take this example from the amateur bakers database It lists friends and family but also important information like who has a nut allergy in the rest of the table So if a database is essentially a collection of lists, store it in tables and you can build tables in Excel Why access? Why do you need a database? Lets compare While Excel is great at storing and organizing numbers, Access is better at analyzing and connecting other types of data For example, names and descriptions or your friends and their favorite cookies The databases youll be working with in Access can actually understand how different lists and their contents relate to one another We call this a relational database for its ability to understand relationships and its really what sets Access apart Lets think about what that means while we go back to our amateur bakers database and build a third list to keep track of batches of cookies and who therefore Its easy to see the relationship here All I did was pull Dwayne from this list and shortbread from here Access can see and use that relationship too, but Excel cant All of these things are completely unrelated as far as Excel is concerned That means you wouldnt be able to pull from one list to another Eventually youd find yourself typing the same thing over and over every time you needed to refer to Dwayne or your shortbread recipe or dad and chock chip In short, access thinks more like you It recognizes that the items in these three lists are connected That makes entering, searching, and analyzing data so much easier, whether you have two lists or 20 Less to type, less to keep track of Even the most complicated tasks can be made simple and userfriendly once you understand how access and databases work Freedom to learn What you want?
