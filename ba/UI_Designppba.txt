User familiarity is the ability of a user to quickly and easily learn and use the interface. The interface should use terms and concepts which are drawn from the experience of the people who will make most use of this system. The interface should be consistent in that, wherever possible, comparable operations should not be activated in the same way. It should always be predictable. Recoverability is the ability to recover from a traumatic event. The interface should include mechanisms to allow users to recover from errors. The interface should provide meaningful feedback when errors occur and provide contextsensitive user help facilities. diversity is the diversity of the human body. The interface should provide appropriate interaction facilities for different types of system user. Design principles User familiarity The interface should be based on user-oriented terms and concepts rather than computer concepts. . The system should display an appropriate level of consistency. The same commands and menus should have the same format, command punctuation should be similar, etc Recoverability This might include an UNDO facility, confirmation of destructive actions, soft deletes, etc. e. Interaction styles The user's context is indicated by the current menu selection. UNIX is a command-oriented system. Problems e Command interfaces are difficult to use A command language is a system language that is used to communicate with computers. The user typed a command. NL processing technology is now good enough to make these interfaces effective for casual users
